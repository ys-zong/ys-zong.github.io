I am currently a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. [Timothy Hospedales](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/index.html) and Dr. [Yongxin Yang](https://yang.ac/), where I am funded by [UKRI CDT in Biomedical AI](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai).
I obtained my BSc in computer science from Tongji University, in 2021.

I am broadly interested in machine learning and its applications in biomedicine, especially with multi-modal learning and large vision-language models. 

Feel free to drop me an email for potential collaborations!
